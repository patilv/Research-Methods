  <h2>Course Description</h2>
  <p>This course provides a comprehensive introduction to business research methods for graduate students in MBA and MSBA programs. Students learn to formulate research problems, select appropriate research designs, collect data using qualitative and quantitative methods, and analyze results to support evidence-based business decision-making. The course emphasizes both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of research methodology, with an integrated focus on ethical research practices grounded in the Jesuit tradition.</p>

  <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
  <p>Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Translate a management problem into a feasible research question with clear objectives and testable hypotheses</li>
    <li>Select and justify an appropriate research design (exploratory, descriptive, or causal) for a given business problem</li>
    <li>Evaluate secondary data sources and conduct a structured literature review</li>
    <li>Design and critique qualitative research studies, including focus groups, interviews, and observational methods</li>
    <li>Construct valid and reliable survey instruments with proper measurement scales</li>
    <li>Develop sampling plans that balance rigor, feasibility, and cost</li>
    <li>Apply fundamental statistical tests (chi-square, t-tests, ANOVA) and interpret their results in a business context</li>
    <li>Prepare professional research reports that communicate findings and strategic recommendations</li>
    <li>Integrate ethical considerations into every stage of the research process</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Required Readings</h2>
  <p>There is no single required textbook. Instead, this course provides comprehensive module content supplemented by readings from the following sources, which are recommended for deeper study:</p>

  <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
  <p>All students are expected to adhere to Gonzaga University's Academic Integrity Policy. In a course focused on research methods, integrity is not merely a policy requirement but a professional imperative. Plagiarism, fabrication of data, or misrepresentation of sources undermines the entire purpose of evidence-based inquiry. If you are uncertain about proper attribution, ask.</p>

  <h2>Accessibility and Accommodations</h2>
  <p>Gonzaga University is committed to providing equal access to educational opportunities for all students. If you have a documented disability and require accommodations, please contact the Center for Student Academic Success (CSAS) at the beginning of the term. The instructor will work with CSAS to ensure appropriate accommodations are provided.</p>

  <h2>Academic Support</h2>
  <p>Students are encouraged to take advantage of Gonzaga's academic support resources, including the Writing Center, the library's research assistance services, and office hours with the instructor. Please reach out early if you need support.</p>
