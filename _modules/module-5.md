## 5.1 The Role of Qualitative Research

Qualitative research seeks to understand phenomena from the perspective of those being studied. Rather than quantifying behavior, it aims to **explore meaning, context, and experience**. In the research process, qualitative methods are most commonly used in **exploratory research** (Module 3), though they can also complement descriptive and causal studies.

Qualitative research is particularly valuable when we need to:
- Understand how people think about a topic in their own words
- Explore complex phenomena that cannot be reduced to numbers
- Generate hypotheses for subsequent quantitative testing
- Uncover motivations, attitudes, and beliefs that underlie behavior
- Provide rich, contextual detail that quantitative data cannot capture

## 5.2 Types of Variables in Business Research

Before discussing specific qualitative methods, it is useful to review the types of variables that business research studies. Understanding variable types helps the researcher select appropriate data collection methods:

- **Demographic and economic variables**: Age, gender, income, education, occupation, household size, geographic location
- **Psychological and lifestyle variables**: Personality traits, values, activities, interests, opinions (the "AIO" framework)
- **Attitudes and opinions**: Predispositions toward objects, people, or ideas. An *attitude* is an enduring predisposition; an *opinion* is its verbal expression.
- **Awareness and knowledge**: What consumers know (or think they know) about products, brands, or issues
- **Intentions**: Planned future behavior (e.g., purchase intent, likelihood to recommend)
- **Motivations**: Underlying drives that explain why people behave as they do
- **Behavior**: What has occurred and/or is currently occurring—observable actions and choices

Some of these variables (demographics, behavior) are relatively easy to measure with structured, quantitative methods. Others (motivations, deep attitudes, the meaning of experiences) are better explored through qualitative methods.

## 5.3 Case Studies and Pilot Studies

Two preliminary qualitative approaches are often used in the early stages of research (Zikmund et al., 2013):

**Case studies** are documented histories of a particular person, group, organization, or event. In business research, a case study might examine how a specific company responded to a crisis, entered a new market, or implemented a new strategy. Case studies provide depth and context but are limited in generalizability—findings from one case may not apply to others.

**Pilot studies** are small-scale, preliminary investigations that use sampling but do not apply the rigorous standards of full-scale research. A pilot study might involve conducting a small number of interviews to test the feasibility of a research approach, refine interview questions, or identify unexpected issues before committing to a larger study. Pilot studies generate primary data for qualitative analysis and are invaluable for improving the design of subsequent research.

## 5.4 Depth Interviews

A **depth interview** is a one-on-one, semi-structured conversation between a trained researcher and a respondent, conducted to explore a topic in depth (Churchill & Iacobucci, 2015). The interviewer uses a **topic guide** (a list of themes and probing questions) rather than a rigid script, allowing the conversation to follow the respondent's lead while ensuring key topics are covered.

### Characteristics of Effective Depth Interviews
- **Duration**: Typically 30–90 minutes
- **Setting**: Comfortable, private environment (in-person or virtual)
- **Interviewer skills**: Active listening, neutral probing, ability to build rapport without leading the respondent
- **Recording**: Audio or video recording (with consent) for later analysis

### When to Use Depth Interviews
- The topic is sensitive or personal (e.g., financial decisions, health behaviors)
- You need to understand individual experiences in detail
- Group dynamics might inhibit honest responses
- The population is difficult to assemble in groups (e.g., C-suite executives)

## 5.5 Focus Groups

A **focus group** is a moderated group discussion among 6–10 participants, guided by a trained moderator who follows a structured discussion guide. Focus groups leverage **group interaction**—participants respond to and build upon each other's comments, generating richer insights than individual interviews alone might produce.

### How Many Focus Groups?

There is no single correct number. General guidelines include:
- A minimum of **two groups per segment** of interest (to distinguish genuine patterns from group-specific dynamics)
- Continue until **theoretical saturation** is reached—the point at which additional groups are unlikely to reveal new themes
- In practice, most studies conduct **4–8 focus groups** in total

### Advantages of Focus Groups
- **Immediate, spontaneous insights**: The group dynamic generates ideas quickly
- **Rich qualitative data**: Participants explain their reasoning in their own words
- **High idea generation**: The interactive format produces more ideas than individual interviews
- **Observation of social dynamics**: Researchers can observe how people discuss and negotiate meaning

### Disadvantages of Focus Groups
- **Limited generalizability**: Small, non-random samples cannot represent the broader population
- **Subjective interpretation**: Analyzing focus group data requires judgment; different analysts may reach different conclusions
- **Moderator dependency**: The quality of the data depends heavily on the moderator's skill. A poor moderator can lead the group, suppress minority opinions, or allow dominant participants to dominate.
- **Group effects**: Social desirability, conformity pressure, and groupthink can distort responses

## 5.6 Projective Techniques

When direct questioning may not elicit honest or insightful responses—either because respondents cannot articulate their feelings or are unwilling to share them—**projective techniques** offer an indirect approach. These techniques ask respondents to project their attitudes, feelings, or motivations onto ambiguous stimuli.

### Common Projective Techniques

**Word Association**: Respondents react to a list of words with the first association(s) that come to mind. Analysis focuses on the frequency of specific associations, the response time (faster responses suggest stronger emotional connections), and the number of non-responses (which may indicate blocked or uncomfortable associations).

**Sentence / Story Completion**: Respondents complete sentences or stories that are designed to elicit attitudes and feelings. For example:
- "Walmart is ______________."
- "People who shop at Walmart are ______________."
- "I don't understand why Walmart doesn't ______________."

Story completion provides even richer data by situating the prompt in a narrative context.

**Cartoon or Picture Completion**: Respondents are shown a cartoon or image depicting a scenario (e.g., two people in a store) and asked to fill in dialogue bubbles or describe what is happening.

**Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) Adaptations**: Respondents are shown ambiguous pictures and asked to tell a story about the people depicted: Who are they? What are they discussing? What are they feeling? The assumption is that respondents project their own attitudes and experiences onto the characters.

### Interpreting Projective Techniques
Interpretation is based on:
- **Frequency** of specific associations or themes
- **Response latency** — shorter response times suggest stronger emotional involvement
- **Non-response rates** — high non-response may indicate high involvement that blocks articulation

<div class="callout callout-warning">
<p class="callout-title">Use With Caution</p>
<p>Projective techniques require skilled interpretation and are susceptible to researcher bias. They should be used as one source of evidence among many—not as the sole basis for strategic decisions.</p>
</div>

## 5.7 Observation Methods

**Observation** involves systematically watching and recording behavior as it naturally occurs (or in contrived settings). Observation can capture what people actually do, rather than what they say they do—an important distinction, since self-reported behavior often diverges from actual behavior.

### Dimensions of Observation

Observation methods can be classified along five dimensions:

| Dimension | Options | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | Structured / Unstructured | Whether the observer uses a predetermined checklist or records freely |
| **Disguise** | Disguised / Undisguised | Whether the subjects know they are being observed |
| **Directness** | Direct / Indirect | Whether the behavior itself is observed or its traces/artifacts are studied |
| **Setting** | Natural / Contrived | Whether the observation takes place in the subject's natural environment or in a controlled setting |
| **Observer** | Human / Mechanical | Whether a human observer or a recording device captures the data |

### Examples

- **Structured observation**: Recording the number of cans a shopper picks up before making a choice in the soup aisle, including the first can picked up, total cans examined, and total time in the section.
- **Indirect observation**: Studying which radio stations car drivers listen to by checking the dial position in parked cars. Or determining the popularity of museum exhibits by examining scuff marks on the floor tiles.
- **Mechanical observation**: Eye-tracking cameras to study where consumers look on packaging or advertisements; in-store cameras to study traffic patterns; galvanometers to measure physiological arousal in response to advertising.

### What Can Be Observed

Observable phenomena include physical actions, verbal behavior, expressive behavior (facial expressions, body language), spatial patterns (where people go, how they navigate), temporal patterns (how long they spend), and physical objects (what they carry, wear, or consume).

### What Cannot Be Observed: Limitations

Observation has important limits (adapted from Churchill & Iacobucci, 2015):

- **Observation can describe but not explain**: You can see *what* happened but not *why*
- **Long-term observation is expensive or impractical**: Sustained observation over weeks or months is resource-intensive
- **Cognitive phenomena are invisible**: Thoughts, attitudes, motivations, intentions, and knowledge cannot be directly observed
- **Interpretation can be problematic**: Observers may interpret the same behavior differently
- **Not all activity can be recorded**: Important behaviors may occur when the observer is not present
- **Observer bias**: The observer's expectations and preconceptions can influence what is recorded
- **Privacy concerns**: Observation—especially disguised observation—raises significant ethical questions about invasion of privacy

<div class="callout callout-jesuit">
<p class="callout-title">Jesuit Perspective</p>
<p>Qualitative research at its best embodies the Jesuit commitment to seeing the whole person—not reducing individuals to numbers or categories, but understanding their experiences, motivations, and contexts in their full complexity. At the same time, the Jesuit tradition demands honesty and intellectual rigor. Qualitative researchers must be transparent about the subjective elements of their interpretations and vigilant against confirmation bias. The goal is not just empathy but <em>accurate</em> empathy—understanding that is both compassionate and true.</p>

## 5.8 Emerging Qualitative Methods

While traditional qualitative methods remain foundational, several newer approaches have gained prominence:

### Netnography (Online Ethnography)
Systematic study of online communities, forums, social media conversations, and user-generated content. Researchers analyze naturally occurring online discourse to understand consumer culture, brand perceptions, and community dynamics (Kozinets, 2020).

### Mobile Ethnography
Participants use their smartphones to document their experiences in real time—capturing photos, videos, audio diaries, and text entries as they go about their daily lives. This approach reduces recall bias and captures behavior in context.

### Co-Creation and Participatory Design
Researchers involve participants as active collaborators in the research process—not just as data sources but as co-designers of solutions. This approach is particularly valuable in service design and product innovation.

### Empathy Mapping and Journey Mapping
Visual tools that synthesize qualitative data into actionable frameworks. Empathy maps capture what a customer thinks, feels, says, and does. Journey maps trace the customer experience across touchpoints and over time.

## 5.9 Limitations of Qualitative Research

Despite its richness, qualitative research has inherent limitations that must be acknowledged:

- **Susceptibility to misuse and misinterpretation**: Qualitative findings can be selectively quoted to support a predetermined conclusion
- **Limited generalizability**: Small, non-random samples do not represent the broader population statistically
- **Moderator/interviewer dependence**: The quality of data is highly dependent on the skill of the facilitator
- **Subjectivity in analysis**: Different analysts may draw different conclusions from the same data
- **Time and cost per respondent**: While individual qualitative studies may be less expensive than large surveys, the cost per respondent is typically higher

The strongest research programs use qualitative and quantitative methods in complementary roles: qualitative research to explore, understand, and generate hypotheses; quantitative research to test, measure, and generalize.
