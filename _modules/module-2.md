## 2.1 The Central Importance of Problem Formulation

Of all the steps in the research process, **problem formulation** may be the most consequential. A brilliantly designed study that addresses the wrong question wastes time and resources. Conversely, a clear and well-defined problem sets the stage for effective research at every subsequent stage.

As the statistician John Tukey reportedly said:

> "An approximate answer to the right question is worth a great deal more than a precise answer to the wrong question."

Problem formulation is the process of **defining and developing a decision statement** and translating it into precise research terminology, including a set of research objectives and testable hypotheses (Zikmund et al., 2013). This module walks through that process step by step.

## 2.2 Sources of Research Problems

Research problems and opportunities arise from three primary sources:

### Unanticipated Change
External events—economic shifts, new regulations, competitive moves, technological disruptions, or social trends—create problems or opportunities that management did not foresee. A sudden drop in sales, an unexpected surge in customer complaints, or a new competitor entering the market can all trigger the need for research.

### Planned Change
Organizations proactively seek research when planning strategic initiatives. Before launching a new product, entering a new geographic market, or restructuring a division, a well-managed organization will conduct research to inform the decision. The research here is anticipatory, not reactive.

### Serendipity
Occasionally, research needs arise from unexpected discoveries. A sales team notices an unusual pattern in customer behavior. An analyst stumbles upon an intriguing trend in secondary data. A casual conversation with a customer reveals an unmet need. These serendipitous observations can spark formal research investigations.

<div class="callout callout-case-study">
<p class="callout-title">Case Study: The Surgical Mask Manufacturer</p>
<p>Consider a manufacturer of surgical masks that has experienced a loss of sales and market share. The managerial objective is straightforward: increase company sales and profits. But the research objective is initially unclear—<em>why</em> is the company losing sales?</p>
<p>This case, adapted from Churchill and Iacobucci (2015), illustrates how problem formulation unfolds across multiple stages of research:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exploratory research</strong> (Stage 1) reveals several potential causes: poor fit, excessive cost, skin irritation, and fogging of glasses.</li>
<li><strong>Descriptive research</strong> (Stage 2) prioritizes these causes: poor fit (45%), cost (12%), fogging (6%), irritation (1%).</li>
<li><strong>Causal research</strong> (Stage 3) tests whether a new dual-material molded mask (addressing the fit issue) increases sales in a field experiment with three dealers over three months.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how each stage depends on the previous one. Without the exploratory stage to identify possible causes, the company might have invested in the wrong solution (e.g., reducing price when the real problem was fit).</p>
</div>

## 2.3 The Problem Formulation Process

The process of formulating a research problem follows a logical sequence (adapted from Zikmund et al., 2013):

1. **Detect symptoms** — Recognize that something requires investigation (declining sales, rising complaints, a new opportunity)
2. **Analyze the situation** — Gather background information to understand the context
3. **Identify key problems** — Move beyond symptoms to underlying issues
4. **Define the problem precisely** — State what needs to be investigated in clear terms
5. **Conduct exploratory research** (optional) — If the problem is poorly understood, preliminary investigation can sharpen the definition
6. **State the decision statement** — Express the core question the decision-maker needs answered
7. **State the research objectives** — Translate the decision statement into specific, measurable information needs
8. **Develop hypotheses** — Formulate testable propositions that the research will evaluate

### Key Definitions

**Problem definition** is the process of defining and developing a decision statement and the steps involved in translating it into more precise research terminology. It seeks to state research questions clearly and develop well-formulated, specific hypotheses.

**Decision statement** is a written expression of the key question(s) that the research user (i.e., the manager or decision-maker) wishes to answer.

**Research objectives** are statements, in as precise terminology as possible, of what information is needed. They should be framed so that the information obtained will satisfy the research purpose.

## 2.4 From Decision Statements to Research Objectives

The relationship between decision statements and research objectives is one of translation: moving from the language of management to the language of research. Consider these examples (adapted from Zikmund et al., 2013):

| Decision Statement | Research Objective(s) |
|---|---|
| Develop a package for a new product | Evaluate consumer response to alternative package designs |
| Increase store traffic | Measure the current image of the store; identify factors driving foot traffic |
| Increase market penetration by opening new stores | Evaluate prospective locations based on demographic and competitive data |
| Decide which merchandise will be available online | Determine consumers' confidence in purchasing different product categories without physical inspection |

Notice that the decision statement frames the **management problem** (what the manager wants to do), while the research objectives frame the **information needed** to make that decision. The research objective must be specific enough to guide the design of the study.

## 2.5 Hypothesis Development

Once research objectives are established, the researcher develops **hypotheses**—specific, testable propositions about the expected relationships between variables. Hypotheses serve as the bridge between the research question and the research design.

The flow is:

**Decision Statement → Theory / Experience / Exploratory Research → Research Objective → Hypothesis → Research Design**

### Examples

| Decision Statement | Research Objective | Hypothesis |
|---|---|---|
| What should be the retail price for product X? | Forecast sales at three price points ($4.00, $5.00, $6.99) | Sales will be higher at $5.00 than at $4.00 or $6.99 |
| What should we invest in to improve service quality? | Identify top factors contributing to service quality perceptions | Cleanliness is positively related to service quality perceptions; crowding is negatively related to service quality perceptions |
| Should we invest in a training program to reduce role conflict? | Determine the influence of role conflict on employee job satisfaction | Role conflict is negatively related to job satisfaction |

A well-formulated hypothesis has several characteristics:
- It is **specific** — stating a clear expected relationship
- It is **testable** — capable of being confirmed or disconfirmed with data
- It is **grounded** — derived from theory, prior research, or informed judgment (not mere speculation)

<div class="callout callout-key-concept">
<p class="callout-title">Key Concept: Null and Alternative Hypotheses</p>
<p>In formal hypothesis testing (covered in depth in Module 8), we distinguish between:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Null hypothesis (H₀)</strong>: The default assumption—typically that there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship</li>
<li><strong>Alternative hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ)</strong>: The proposition the researcher seeks evidence for—that an effect, difference, or relationship does exist</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: H₀: Average customer satisfaction does not differ between Store A and Store B. Hₐ: Average customer satisfaction differs between Store A and Store B.</p>
</div>

## 2.6 The Research Request: A Six-Part Framework

Before a research project begins, a formal **research request** helps ensure alignment between the decision-maker and the researcher. A well-structured research request includes six components (Churchill & Iacobucci, 2015):

1. **Action**: What actions are being considered on the basis of the research? This forces clarity about how the results will actually be used.

2. **Origin**: What events or circumstances led to the need for research? While these may not directly affect the research design, they help the researcher understand the broader context.

3. **Information**: What specific questions does the decision-maker need answered? This is the heart of the request—the information requirements.

4. **Use**: How will each piece of information be used to make the decision? This critical step ensures that every question in the research serves a purpose. If a piece of information cannot be linked to a specific decision, it may not be worth collecting.

5. **Targets and Subgroups**: From whom must the information be gathered? Specifying the target population helps the researcher design an appropriate sample.

6. **Logistics**: What are the approximate time and budget constraints? Both will affect the feasible research methods and scope.

<div class="callout callout-example">
<p class="callout-title">Example: Regional Coffee Chain</p>
<p>A regional coffee chain is considering adding a drive-through service at existing locations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: Decide whether to invest $2M in drive-through construction at 15 locations</li>
<li><strong>Origin</strong>: Competitors with drive-throughs have seen 20% revenue increases; customer feedback mentions convenience</li>
<li><strong>Information</strong>: (a) What percentage of current customers would use a drive-through? (b) What is the expected increase in visit frequency? (c) What is the estimated revenue impact per location?</li>
<li><strong>Use</strong>: (a) determines demand; (b) and (c) feed the financial model for ROI calculation</li>
<li><strong>Targets</strong>: Current customers at the 15 candidate locations; non-customers in surrounding 5-mile radius</li>
<li><strong>Logistics</strong>: Results needed within 6 weeks; budget of $75,000</li>
</ul>
</div>

## 2.7 Key Questions at Each Stage of the Research Process

One of the most practical skills in research is knowing which questions to ask at each stage. The following table, adapted from Churchill and Iacobucci (2015), provides a comprehensive guide:

### Problem Formulation Stage
- What is the purpose of the study? To solve a problem? To identify an opportunity?
- Is additional background information necessary?
- What information is needed to make the decision?
- How will the information be utilized?
- Should research be conducted at all?

### Research Design Stage
- How much is already known about this problem?
- Can a hypothesis be formulated?
- What types of questions need to be answered?
- What type of study will best address the research questions?

### Data Collection Method and Forms Stage
- Can existing data be used?
- What is to be measured, and how?
- What is the source of the data?
- Can objective answers be obtained by asking people?
- How should people be questioned? (In person, by phone, online, by mail?)
- Should electronic or mechanical means be used for observation?
- Should structured or unstructured items be used?
- Should the study purpose be disclosed to respondents?
- Should rating scales be used?

### Sampling and Data Collection Stage
- Who is the target population?
- Is a list of population elements available?
- Is a sample necessary, or should a census be conducted?
- Is a probability sample desirable?
- How large should the sample be?
- How should the sample be selected?
- Who will collect the data, and with what supervision?
- What operational procedures and quality controls will be followed?

### Analysis and Interpretation Stage
- How will the data be edited and coded?
- What tabulations, visualizations, and analysis techniques are appropriate?

### Reporting Stage
- Who will read the report? What is their level of technical sophistication?
- Are managerial recommendations expected?
- What format should the written and oral reports take?

## 2.8 Research Boundaries and Scope

An often-overlooked aspect of problem formulation is defining what the research will **not** cover. Research boundaries help manage expectations and focus resources:

- **Geographic scope**: Are we studying a single market, a region, or a national population?
- **Time frame**: Are we interested in current attitudes or historical trends?
- **Population boundaries**: Which stakeholders are included? Customers only, or also employees, suppliers, and community members?
- **Depth vs. breadth**: Will we study a few variables deeply or many variables broadly?

Setting clear boundaries prevents scope creep—the tendency for research projects to expand beyond their original mandate, consuming time and budget without proportional gains in useful information.

<div class="callout callout-jesuit">
<p class="callout-title">Jesuit Perspective</p>
<p>Problem formulation is inherently an act of framing: what we choose to study—and what we choose not to study—reflects our values and priorities. The Jesuit tradition encourages us to ask not only "What is the most profitable question?" but also "What is the most important question?" Sometimes the most impactful research addresses the needs of underserved stakeholders, marginalized communities, or overlooked dimensions of a problem. <em>Magis</em>—the pursuit of the greater good—challenges us to formulate problems that matter.</p>

## 2.9 Common Pitfalls in Problem Formulation

Even experienced researchers can fall into traps during problem formulation:

- **Confusing symptoms with problems**: Declining sales is a symptom. The underlying problem might be product quality, pricing, competitive pressure, distribution, or something else entirely.
- **Defining the problem too broadly**: "We need to understand our customers better" is not a research problem. It needs to be narrowed to a specific, actionable question.
- **Defining the problem too narrowly**: Conversely, focusing too tightly can cause researchers to miss the real issue. If the company only studies price sensitivity when the actual problem is poor product fit, the research will not help.
- **Accepting the client's initial framing uncritically**: Decision-makers often come to researchers with a preconceived notion of the problem. The researcher's job is to probe, question, and refine—not simply to execute the client's initial request.
