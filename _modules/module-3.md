## 3.1 Linking Problems to Designs

In Module 2, we learned how to formulate research problems, objectives, and hypotheses. The next critical decision is: **what type of research design will best address the question?**

The choice of research design is fundamentally determined by **the degree of uncertainty** surrounding the problem:

- If the problem is **poorly understood** and we need to clarify what is happening, an **exploratory** design is appropriate.
- If the problem is **well-defined** and we need to describe the characteristics of a population or phenomenon, a **descriptive** design is appropriate.
- If we need to determine **whether one variable causes a change in another**, a **causal** design is required.

These three designs are not mutually exclusive. As the surgical mask case study in Module 2 illustrated, a research program may progress through all three stages: exploratory research to identify possible causes, descriptive research to quantify their prevalence, and causal research to test whether a proposed solution works.

<p class="callout-title">Key Concept</p>
<p>The degree of uncertainty about the research problem determines the methodology. Greater uncertainty calls for more flexible, exploratory approaches. Greater certainty enables more structured, confirmatory designs.</p>
</div>

## 3.2 Exploratory Research

**Exploratory research** is conducted when the researcher has limited knowledge about the problem. Its primary purposes include (Zikmund et al., 2013):

- Formulating a problem for more precise investigation or developing hypotheses
- Establishing priorities for further research
- Gathering information about the practical challenges of conducting research on the topic
- Increasing the researcher's familiarity with the problem
- Clarifying concepts
- Generating new product or service concepts, problem solutions, or lists of product features
- Getting preliminary reactions to new ideas
- Pretesting structured questionnaires
- Understanding the consumer's perspective, vocabulary, needs, and usage situations

### Characteristics of Exploratory Research

Exploratory research is:
- **Flexible and unstructured** — The researcher adapts the approach as new information emerges
- **Predominantly qualitative** — Focus groups, depth interviews, case studies, and observation are typical methods
- **Small-scale** — Sample sizes are usually small and not statistically representative
- **Hypothesis-generating** — The goal is to develop hypotheses, not test them

### When to Use Exploratory Research

Exploratory research is most appropriate when:
- The research problem is ambiguous or vague
- You are entering an unfamiliar domain (new market, new product category, new culture)
- The existing literature provides little guidance
- You need to understand how people think about, talk about, or experience a phenomenon

## 3.3 Descriptive Research

**Descriptive research** aims to describe the characteristics of a population, phenomenon, or market situation. It answers questions of **who, what, when, where, and how** (though not necessarily *why*).

Descriptive studies can:
- Describe characteristics of groups (e.g., the demographic profile of a brand's customers)
- Estimate the proportion of people who behave in a certain way (e.g., the percentage of consumers who shop online weekly)
- Make specific predictions about the relationship between marketing variables (e.g., predicting how advertising spending relates to brand awareness)

### Characteristics of Descriptive Research

Unlike exploratory research, descriptive studies are:
- **Structured and rigid** — The research design, questions, and data collection methods are determined in advance
- **Predominantly quantitative** — Surveys and structured observations are typical methods
- **Larger sample sizes** — Statistical representativeness is a goal
- **Hypothesis-testing** (in some cases) — Descriptive research can test hypotheses about relationships, though it cannot establish causation

### An Accurate Snapshot

Descriptive research provides an accurate snapshot of some aspect of the market environment. Examples include:

- The proportion of the adult population that supports a charitable cause
- Consumer evaluations of product attributes versus competing products
- The socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of a magazine's readership
- The proportion of retail outlets that carry, display, or merchandise a particular product

### Types of Descriptive Studies

Descriptive studies can be classified as:

| Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Cross-sectional** (Sample Survey) | Data collected from a sample at a single point in time | A customer satisfaction survey conducted in March |
| **Longitudinal** | Data collected from the same (or comparable) sample over time | A panel study tracking the same consumers' purchasing behavior monthly |

Longitudinal designs can be further divided into:
- **True panels**: The same individuals are surveyed repeatedly on the same topics
- **Omnibus panels**: The same individuals are surveyed repeatedly, but topics may change over time

Longitudinal designs are powerful for studying change over time but are more expensive and subject to **panel attrition** (participants dropping out over time).

## 3.4 Causal Research

**Causal research** seeks to identify cause-and-effect relationships. When a manager asks, "Will changing X lead to a change in Y?"—that is a causal question. Causal research typically involves **experiments**.

### Requirements for Establishing Causation

To claim that variable X causes variable Y, three conditions must be satisfied (adapted from Churchill & Iacobucci, 2015):

**1. Concomitant Variation**
X and Y must occur together (or vary together) in the way predicted by the hypothesis. If we hypothesize that advertising spending increases brand awareness, we should observe that higher ad spending is associated with higher awareness. However, correlation alone is not sufficient for causation.

*Examples*:
- Sales person compensation → Sales performance
- Ad severity (fear appeal) → Ad effectiveness

**2. Temporal Antecedence (Time Order)**
The cause (X) must occur **before** the effect (Y). If we claim that a training program improves performance, we must show that performance improved *after* the training was implemented, not before.

**3. Elimination of Other Possible Causal Factors (Nonspurious Association)**
We must have evidence that allows us to rule out alternative explanations. If both advertising spending and brand awareness increased, but so did a competitor's product recall, the awareness increase might be due to the recall rather than our advertising. This is the requirement of **internal validity**—the degree to which the observed effect can be attributed to the experimental treatment rather than to confounding factors.

> "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
> — Arthur Conan Doyle, *The Sign of the Four* (1890)

While Sherlock Holmes may overstate the ease of elimination, the principle is sound: establishing causation requires systematically ruling out alternative explanations.

## 3.5 Threats to Internal Validity

**Internal validity** refers to the degree to which the observed results of an experiment can be attributed to the experimental treatment (the independent variable) rather than to other, extraneous factors. Several well-documented threats can undermine internal validity (Campbell & Stanley, 1963; Cook & Campbell, 1979):

| Threat | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **History** | An external event (other than the treatment) occurs during the experiment and affects the outcome | A competitor launches a major promotion during your pricing experiment |
| **Maturation** | Natural changes in participants over time that are unrelated to the treatment | Employees become more experienced over the duration of a training study |
| **Testing** | The initial measurement itself affects subsequent responses | Taking a pretest on brand knowledge makes participants more attentive to brand information |
| **Instrumentation** | Changes in the measurement instrument, observers, or procedures over time | A survey question is reworded midway through data collection |
| **Selection** | Pre-existing differences between experimental and control groups | Volunteers for a new work program may already be more motivated than non-volunteers |
| **Mortality (Attrition)** | Participants drop out of the study before completion, and drop-outs differ systematically from those who remain | Dissatisfied customers are more likely to drop out of a longitudinal satisfaction study |

Understanding these threats is essential for designing studies that yield credible causal conclusions and for critically evaluating research conducted by others.

## 3.6 External Validity

While internal validity asks "Did X really cause Y in this study?", **external validity** asks "Can we generalize these findings to other settings, populations, and times?" A study can have strong internal validity but limited external validity—and vice versa.

This tension is most apparent in the comparison between laboratory and field experiments.

## 3.7 Laboratory vs. Field Experiments

| Dimension | Laboratory Experiment | Field Experiment |
|---|---|---|
| **Setting** | Artificial, controlled environment | Natural, real-world environment |
| **Realism** | Low (participants know they are in a study) | High (participants may be unaware) |
| **Control over extraneous variables** | High | Low |
| **Internal validity** | Typically higher | Typically lower |
| **External validity** | Typically lower | Typically higher |
| **Cost** | Generally lower | Generally higher |
| **Duration** | Usually shorter | Usually longer |
| **Participant awareness** | Participants are typically aware | Participants may be unaware |

### When to Choose Each

**Laboratory experiments** are ideal when:
- You need tight control over extraneous variables
- You want to isolate the precise effect of one variable on another
- The research question is about a psychological mechanism (e.g., how framing affects choice)

**Field experiments** are ideal when:
- Realism and generalizability are paramount
- You need to test a marketing intervention in an actual market setting (e.g., a price test in real stores)
- You want to observe natural behavior rather than behavior in a contrived setting

<div class="callout callout-example">
<p class="callout-title">Example: A/B Testing as Field Experimentation</p>
<p>Modern digital marketing has made field experimentation accessible and affordable. <strong>A/B testing</strong>—randomly assigning website visitors to different versions of a page—is a form of field experiment. It takes place in a natural setting (the user's normal browsing), uses random assignment (providing internal validity), and measures real behavior (providing external validity). The rise of A/B testing illustrates how technology has shifted the balance, making it possible to achieve both internal and external validity simultaneously in certain contexts.</p>

## 3.8 Matching Designs to Data Collection Methods

Different research designs naturally pair with different data collection methods. The following table summarizes the most appropriate pairings (adapted from Churchill & Iacobucci, 2015):

| Data Collection Method | Exploratory | Descriptive | Causal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Secondary data analysis** | Most appropriate | | |
| **Qualitative research** (interviews, focus groups, unstructured observation) | Most appropriate | | |
| **Surveys** (and structured observation) | | Most appropriate | |
| **Experiments** | | | Most appropriate |

These pairings are guidelines, not rules. Surveys can include exploratory questions, and experiments can include descriptive measures. But understanding the typical alignment helps researchers make sound design choices.

## 3.9 Qualitative vs. Quantitative: A Comparative Overview

A recurring theme across research designs is the distinction between qualitative and quantitative approaches. The following comparison (adapted from McDaniel & Gates, 2002, Table 5.1) provides a useful summary:

| Dimension | Qualitative Research | Quantitative Research |
|---|---|---|
| **Nature of questions** | Open-ended, deep probing | Structured, limited probing |
| **Sample size** | Small | Large |
| **Information quality** | Rich, contextual, detailed | Varies; standardized |
| **Analytical skills** | Analysis of textual/non-numerical data | Analysis of numerical data |
| **Nature of analysis** | Subjective; higher potential for researcher bias | Statistical; lower potential for researcher bias |
| **Reliability (replicability)** | Lower | Higher |
| **Typical research type** | Exploratory | Descriptive or causal |

Neither approach is inherently superior. The choice depends on the research question, the stage of the research process, and the type of evidence needed. Many of the strongest research programs use **mixed methods**—qualitative research to understand phenomena and generate hypotheses, followed by quantitative research to test those hypotheses and quantify effects.

<div class="callout callout-jesuit">
<p class="callout-title">Jesuit Perspective</p>
<p>The Jesuit intellectual tradition values both depth and rigor—understanding the particular (qualitative) and the general (quantitative). <em>Discernment</em>, a cornerstone of Ignatian spirituality, involves careful reflection on evidence from multiple sources before making a decision. In research design, discernment manifests as the thoughtful selection of methods that are genuinely appropriate for the question at hand, rather than defaulting to familiar techniques. The best researchers, like the best leaders, match their tools to the task.</p>

## 3.10 Choosing the Right Design: A Decision Framework

When selecting a research design, consider the following questions:

1. **How well-defined is the problem?**
   - Vague → Exploratory
   - Well-defined → Descriptive or Causal

2. **What type of evidence is needed?**
   - Understanding and context → Qualitative/Exploratory
   - Frequencies, proportions, correlations → Descriptive
   - Cause-and-effect → Causal/Experimental

3. **What is the stage of the research program?**
   - Early stage, generating ideas → Exploratory
   - Middle stage, quantifying patterns → Descriptive
   - Late stage, testing interventions → Causal

4. **What are the resource constraints?**
   - Limited time/budget → Exploratory or cross-sectional descriptive
   - More resources available → Longitudinal descriptive or experimental

5. **What are the stakes?**
   - High-stakes, irreversible decisions → Invest in causal research
   - Lower-stakes, reversible decisions → Descriptive may suffice
