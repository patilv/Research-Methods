  <h2>Course Overview</h2>
  <p><strong>Strategic Business Research Methods</strong> is a comprehensive, asynchronous graduate course that equips MBA and MSBA students with the methodological foundations needed to design, execute, and evaluate business research. The course bridges the gap between rigorous methodology and practical business application, providing actionable skills for evidence-based decision-making.</p>
  <p>Across eight carefully sequenced modules, students progress from understanding why research matters for strategic leadership, through the mechanics of research design, data collection, and analysis, to the art of communicating findings that drive organizational action. Each module integrates real-world business cases, hands-on exercises, and ethical reflection rooted in the Jesuit tradition.</p>

  <h2>Jesuit Values in Business Research</h2>
  <p>As a course offered through Gonzaga University, a Jesuit institution, this material is deeply informed by the Ignatian tradition of intellectual inquiry. We believe that business research is not merely a technical exercise but an ethical practice that carries real consequences for people and communities.</p>
